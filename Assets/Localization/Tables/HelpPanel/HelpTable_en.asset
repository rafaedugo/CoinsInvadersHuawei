    m_Localized: "After the 2008 crisis, an anonymous Internet user who identifies
      himself as Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin as a new currency, a new decentralized
      digital asset designed to function as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography
      and the blockchain to control its creation and management that does not depend
      on the control of governments or central banks, to help people break free from
      the monetary madness of the Fed.\r\n\r\nBitcoin was born as a decentralized
      currency, with peer-to-peer transactions to operate throughout the world. A
      safe currency and, to the horror of the bankers, unconfiscable by the state.
      On the Internet they begin to make fun of this new currency, disparagingly
      calling it, \"cryptocurrency\", but many begin to see its potential and in
      2010 the first known exchange takes place: Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas
      for 10,000 bitcoins, which at the time was equivalent at $ 30. That is, each
      Bitcoin was equal to $ 0.003.\r\n\r\nMany people start betting on Bitcoin and
      this scares the various manipulative forces in the world. Different cryptocurrencies
      are beginning to be created that want to take advantage of the prestige of
      Bitcoin to steal people's money and, incidentally, discredit Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nIn
      2014, when Bitcoin was already being exchanged for $ 1,000, a force from the
      dark side of the world tried to pervert Bitcoin by creating a new currency
      called Etherium. Although it is also based on cryptography and blockchain,
      many dark forces control this currency, it is no longer 100% decentralized
      and strange things come up like NFTs. And the first fight between cryptocurrencies
      begins.\r\n\r\nBut the great manipulators of the money market, the bankers
      very friendly to the FED, could not let people go free again thanks to Bitcoin
      and conspired to create a new type of cryptocurrency, linked to the value of
      the dollar. And so Tether arises, a stable-coin whose value is linked to the
      dollar. It is the closest cryptocurrency to fiat money, to the dollar that
      has lost 90% of its value in the last 50 years, with which they want to confuse
      and deceive people of good will.\r\n\r\nAs the subject of cryptography and
      blockchain is computer science, the world's large technology companies unite
      to try to stop Bitcoin with a new manipulative alternative and in 2019, Libra,
      the cryptocurrency of the technological ones. Although formally it is one of
      the great technologies that assumes the leadership of the currency, surely
      you have some of its apps on your smartphone, all the technologies are involved.
      Anything goes in this war to undermine trust in Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBut in a world
      where fiat money rules and unicorn companies flourish, social media memes have
      great power in the world. And a great of the world, with dreams of traveling
      to other worlds, takes advantage of his knowledge of this meme world to have
      fun promoting an old cryptocurrency that had been launched in memes: Dogecoin.
      And with the power of the meme, he sets out to try to conquer the world and
      become a millionaire through this cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nAnd so there are many
      other cryptocurrencies that enter into a fight every year and several dozen
      cryptocurrencies are launched that try to obtain the savings of the good people
      who can still save. Thus, the world is now invaded by many currencies, by many
      cryptocurrencies that fight fiercely to survive, that try to destroy Bitcoin
      and take advantage of the good of humanity.\r\n\r\nCoins Invaders was born
      in this format, a tribute to the great Japanese designer Toshihiro Nishikado
      and his famous video game Space Invaders from 1978, to reflect the unequal
      fight that Bitcoin has with other cryptocurrencies that arise from dark forces
      in the world to pervert good people and keep them prisoners on his communist
      Orwellian fiat money farm.\r\n\r\nDrive the ship that will be in charge of
      taking bitcoin to its great victory, don't let the altcoins get in the way,
      they will try everything possible to defeat you and destroy the ship. A ship
      that is protected by gold shields, the physical currency that has helped humanity
      in the last 5 thousand years, and where you can see how billions of dollars
      are thrown into the currency market thanks to the quantitative expansion of
      the FED.\r\n\r\nIf you believe in the success of Bitcoin, you can have fun
      destroying various altercoins in an all-out war. May the best cryptocurrency
      win!\r"
